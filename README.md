My bachelor thesis project.

There were 2 phases:
The experimental one where i used Angular, Python Flask API and Solr to run my experiments and and the final deployment of an efficient system using Angular and Solr. during the project the efficiency of TF_IDF and BM25 was tested using techiques like stemming, lemmatization, Word2Vec and Glove.

In particular,the developed model is using
similarities between texts and text collections, and given a title and an abstract, will
provide to user the most relevant journals for his paper.
